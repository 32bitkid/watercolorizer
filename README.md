## Inspiration & Credits

- [Tyler Hobbs](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/) talk at [Strange Loop Conference 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R9eywArFTE). Most of the core algorithms are implemented using this talk as a basis for the interface.
- Also see the associated blog: [How to Hack a Painting](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/words/how-to-hack-a-painting) by [Tyler Hobbs](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/), though the actual talk is perhaps more _illuminating_ at least for me.
- The original _need_ for this library was being inspired by artwork of [Douglas Herring](http://www.douglasherring.com/)
  in the release of [The Colonel's Bequest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest) and wanting to create
  generative-art based on those sources.
